Classification with the Model:

The machine learning model you’ve trained classifies the image as either a QR code or a barcode.
This part uses the supervised learning model that you’ve developed. The model processes the image and predicts whether the image contains a QR code or a barcode based on features it has learned during training.
It helps in distinguishing between QR codes and barcodes if both types are present in the same dataset or images.
Scanning and Decoding the Codes:

Once the model classifies the image as a QR code or barcode, the project uses a separate scanning mechanism (via the pyzbar library) to decode the content inside the image, such as the data encoded in the QR code or barcode.
If a QR code is detected, it decodes the information encoded in the QR code. Similarly, if a barcode is detected, it decodes the data from the barcode.
